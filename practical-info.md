## Venue

Both conferences will be held at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

*Specific venue details will be announced soon.*

## Travel

There are three airports in the Baltimore-Washington region:
* Baltimore-Washington Airport [BWI](https://bwiairport.com/)
* Reagan National Airport [DCA](https://www.flyreagan.com/)
* Dulles International Airport [IAD](https://www.flydulles.com/)

From each of these, it is possible to get to Baltimore on public transit (but only during the day) in about 1, 2, or 3 hours respectively. A taxi would take about half that time, at a cost proportional to the distance.

Baltimore also has a centrally located [Amtrak station](https://www.amtrak.com/stations/bal), which has a direct connection to the Newark Airport [EWR](https://www.newarkairport.com/) and also runs to Philadelphia, where it is possible to connect to the Philadelphia International Airport [PHL](https://www.phl.org/).
